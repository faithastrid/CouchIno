# Sabertooth Motor Driver Library for ESP32
Sabertooth Arduino library rewritten for ESP32

## Overview ##
The Sabertooth Motor driver is a powerful and versatile board created by Dimension Engineering, Inc. The company provides an open-source Arduino library for users to customize and configure to control their motor driver products. However, it was not initially designed to be compatible with the ESP32 boards.

This repository is my revised library that enables users to use the `SoftwareSerial` example on an ESP32 microcontroller to drive the Sabertooth board. This library may also work with ESP8266 boards, but full functionality is not guaranteed.
